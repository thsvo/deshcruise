      {/* 5.Project Process */}
      <section>
        <h2>5.Project Process</h2>
        <br />
        Developing a high-quality website involves multiple stages, each
        critical to ensuring that the final product meets your needs. The
        process is outlined sequentially below:
        <div className="ml-8">
          <h4>1.Choosing Domain Name</h4>
          Selecting a memorable and relevant domain name is the first step in
          establishing your online presence.
          <h4>2.Understanding Your Needs and Requirements</h4>
          To create a website that truly serves you, we need to fully understand
          your requirements and needs. We may schedule video calls to discuss
          your requirements, goals, and expectations in detail.
          <h4>3.Creating Domain Model (Optional)</h4>
          <p>
            For websites that require data storage - such as blogs or ecommerce
            stores - a well-designed database is essential. Together we&apos;ll
            develop a model that outlines the key entities and their
            relationships.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: For a simple e-commerce store, we might define entities
            such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Store: contains information about the store (e.g. name, version,
              etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
              Product: includes details about each product(e.g. name, price,
              available quantity etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
              User: stores data about registered user (e.g. name, email,
              address, etc.)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In essence, an entity functions as a container for related data.{" "}
            <br />
            We will discuss and refine these entities with you to ensure that
            your database is structured correctly.
          </p>
          <h4>4.Creating a Figma Design</h4>
          Using Figma, we create an initial design template for your website.
          This design serves as the blueprint for the custom code we later
          develop. You are entitled to request up to two revisions to ensure the
          design aligns with your vision.
          <h4>5.Coding</h4>
          Once the design is finalized, we begin coding the website. Our goal is
          to deliver the first version as quickly as possible, allowing you to
          see the results and provide feeedback for further optimization.
          <h4>6.Hosting</h4>
          After coding, the website is deployed on Cloudflare. At this stage,
          your website is live and ready to use.
          <h4>7.Optimization</h4>
          After the website is hosted, we work on optimizing the website. This
          phase focuses on SEO and speed enhacement to ensure a robust,
          high-performance website.
          <h4>8.Code updates</h4>
          Web development frameworks evolve over time, requiring periodic
          updates to maintain compatibility and performance. We ensure that your
          website&apos; code is regularly updated to align with the latest framework
          versions and industry standards.
